         <p class="ourmission"> <br>We're Girls Who Code and we have worked really hard over the past year to make this 
        product work/happen. Our task was to create a product which solves a problem.
        The problem that we thought of was how girls don't really get known as "gamers" and
        how girls get stereotyped as the damsel in distress. We took on this challenge by
        creating a game where a girl is the main character. The girls who took on this challenge were Lekhya, 
        Lisa, Madeline, Anna, Shawna, Gargi, Sakshi, Gabriella, Juliet, Marianna and Grace. The girls characteristics 
           are very different from one another but our goal was the very same. <br></p>

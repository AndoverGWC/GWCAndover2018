      <p class="ourmission">Our task was to create a product which would help support a community problem. The problem we decided to focus on was "Women in Technology". We believe 
this is a major problem in our community, and it also relates to what the Girls Who Code organization's goal. We thought  about how girls don't and aren't
known as gamers, as well as often in stories or games the girl plays a helpless role. We decided to create a video game where the main character is a girl 
and she is strong, brave, and smart. We hope this game will be an influence and set an example for girls around the world to not be afraid of being themselves, 
as well as bring more girls in the computer science field.</p>

         <p class="ourmission"> <br>We are a group of girls, part of the Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit 
           organization aiming to increase the number of women in computer science. The girls who took part in the project were Lekhya, Lisa, Madeline, 
           Anna, Shawna, Gargi, Sakshi, Gabriella, Juliet, Marianna, and Grace. The eleven of us have worked really hard for the past year to 
           create this game, and through the process we have all become good friends. Our characteristics differ from one another, but our goal was the same.

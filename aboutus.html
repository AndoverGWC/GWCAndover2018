         <p class="ourmission"> We're Girls Who Code and we have worked really hard over the past year to make this 
        product work/happen. Our task was to create a product which solves a problem.
        The problem that we thought of was how girls don't really get known as "gamers" and
        how girls get stereotyped as the damsel in distress. We took on this challenge by
        creating a game where a girl is the main character. The girls who took on this challenge were Lekhya, 
        Lisa, Madeline, Ana, Shawna, Gargi, Sakshi, Gabriella, Juliet, Marianna and Grace. The girls characteristics 
        are very different from one another but our goal was the very same. </p>
      
       <li> Gargi is crazy, funny and she loves to figure skate. She can be really loud when she wants to and she
         is very outgoing.</li>
      
      <li>Sakshi loves everything to do with music and art, also she loves unicorns, glitter, butterflies, and everything pink. She also likes to act.</li>
      
      <li> Gabriella is very sarcastic and she likes to draw and play videogames. She also plays the violin.</li>
      <li>Lisa likes to draw and likes to read and play the piano. She also likes to write. She also really likes peeps. </li>
      <li> Madeline loves smores and loves reading and videogames. She also likes to read the news and play the violin.</li>
      <li>Juliet likes to run, sing, dance and bake. People call her funny and she also plays the violin and  the guitar. </li>
      <li>Marianna likes to draw and she plays the piano. People describe her as funny and sort of shy.
        She plays field hockey, soccer and she does track.</li>
